### Using The Docker Cli

Docker for the most part is run from the terminal, the docker cli is fairly straight forward.

Docker cli documentation:
- [Docker Cli](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)

## Project Setup

Once Docker and docker-compose are installed correctly, simply run `docker-compose up` from the root. This will startup both the server and the postgres database. Once the server is up and running simply navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!
